<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Giovanni Bouzari and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently a second year Computer Science Student 
  at the University of Florida. This bootcamp will allow me to get hands on practice through the use of individual projects
and problem solving. I am extremely excited and eager to grow as a developer through the course of this bootcamp.</p>
